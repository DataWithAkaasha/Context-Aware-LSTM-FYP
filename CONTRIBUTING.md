## Contributions & Future Extensions

This project primarily implements a supervised LSTM-based context-aware anomaly detection framework. Contributions from the community are welcome, particularly in areas such as:

- **Mathematical Modeling & Simulation:** Explore theoretical models for dynamic thresholding or anomaly propagation. Contributors can simulate industrial or societal time-series scenarios to better understand model behavior.
- **Optimization Techniques:** Implement theoretical or algorithmic optimization methods to replace current empirical threshold tuning.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Approaches:** Integrate unsupervised or self-supervised anomaly detection techniques, or experiment with transformer-based architectures for improved long-range temporal modeling.
- **Real-World Datasets:** Validate the framework on diverse, multivariate industrial datasets to enhance robustness and generalization.
- **Analysis & Visualization:** Provide additional insights, plots, and performance metrics for anomaly detection in complex time-series data.

We encourage contributors to fork this repository, experiment with new methods, and submit pull requests or open discussions to advance the framework.
